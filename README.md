# CFLstats

This repository contains my code for querying the CFL database using their API: http://api.cfl.ca/. Note that you will need to request access if you want to run this code--and make sure to familiarize yourself with their terms of condition. For the purposes of this repository, I store my key in a text file named `api_token.txt` (which I'm not providing, of course!).
